Deploying a Static Website with S3

I recently finished project where I hosted a static html website on S3 bucket. I have uploaded the reference diagram and scripts I used to deploy the web app on S3 for the project. Please use this information to create a readme file for the project.

1. Create S3 bucket that will host the files for the static website.
2. Create an S3 static website configuration, and link it to the existing bucket.
3. Disable public access block so that others can access the bucket via the internet.
4. Click to bucket website endpoint to check static website hosting is ok.
5. 403 Error as access denied.
6. Create a policy that allows the `s3:GetObject` action for anyone and for all objects within the created bucket.
7. Create an `index.html` file and an `error.html` file containing some dummy text.
8. In a first moment, upload these files manually to the bucket via the AWS console. They should be placed in the root directory of the bucket. 
9. Testing that you can access the website via the internet after click with the S3 Static Website endpoint.


This is the script I used to deploy website on S3.
